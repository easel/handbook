== Creating GitHub Pull Requests

In order to work effectively with git and github, you must understand the philosophy of it's development mode.
Git was created by Linus Torvalds to solve the code management issues experienced by the Linux kernel team. This 
team is highly distributed, highly capable, and very large, so the design requirements for git were to be very 
fast, very flexible, and to work well with a distributed team.

GitHub adds to the core of git a web interface that makes it easy to browse code, create repository forks, and
assign permissions. This combination is extremely powerful when used effectively. In order to work effectively 
in this model, you must be able to create independent changes to your code and
submit them as a functional changeset.

=== Steps

==== Clone the repository 

You may choose to create a local fork, or you may have push rights to the upstream repository. This detail
does not matter, but you must understand the difference and be able to keep your master branch properly
in sync with the upstream if you do need to work out of a work.

To clone the upstream repository for this book, you would run `git clone git@github.com:easel/handbook.git`.
Since it is highly unlikely that you have write permissions to the upstream repository, you would normally
fork the repository using the github web interface and the clone that locally, with 
`git clone git@github.com:YourUserName/handbook.git`.

If you are operating out of a forked repository, you should add a remote for the upstream, 
for instance with `git remote add git@github.com:easel/handbook.git`. This is what will enable
you to track changes from other developers and yourself as they are merged to the upstream master branch.

==== Decide what to implement

Typically, in github, work is tracked via the "Issues" system. If the work you are planning to do is not 
represented by an issue, you should create one and assign it to yourself. This ensures that other folks 
know what you are intending to implement and prevents duplicated work and confusion. It also provides
a convenient place to discuss your plans with other developers.

==== Reset your working tree

It is very important to always start with a clean tree, so you should always run 
`git fetch upstream && git reset --hard upstream/master`
prior to creating your branch. These commands will wipe away any local state and ensure you are starting fresh
with the latest functional code from the upstream master branch. 
Keep in mind that the `upstream` designation in the command refers to the
remote that has has the most up-to-date code. If necessary, you can use the command `git remote -v` to see
all your remotes and to which repository they are pointing. 

TIP: Always reset your working tree before starting work 

==== Create a feature branch

Once you are know what task you are taking on, you should create a feature branch and switch to it 
using the `git checkout -b my_new_branch` command. The branch name, in this case `my_new_branch`,
should be descriptive of the work you intend to do.

==== Implement your feature

This is where development happens. You should get in the habit of checking in early and often so you can 
easily use the power of git to restore yourself to a functional state. You will need to use the `git add 'file'`
command to stage files for committing, and use the `git commit` command to actually save the changes. While you
work, the `git status` command is a good way to keep track of the files you have changed, and the `git diff` command
provides invaluable insight into what changes you have made.

Since you are working in a private branch, there is no penalty for committing early and often, but you should
still make your best effort to create a meaningful commit message describing your change. In addition, you should
get in the habit of pushing your branch to a central repository so others can view it, again, early and often. Assuming
you are operating out of a private fork of the repository, you would use the command `git push origin my_new_branch` to 
send all your commits to github. If your repositor is configured with continuous integration this is a convenient way
to run your full testsuite without slowing down your local development environment, too.

TIP: Commit early and often

==== Open a pull request

Once your branch has been pushed to the origin and is ready for review, you should open a pull request. To do this, browse
to the github ui, find your branch, and click the "compare and create pull request" button. You should look at the changed files
and make sure you have not included anything by accident, and then write a detailed commit message describing the changes
implemented by your branch.

Pull Requests should be separated by concerns - meaning, if you are implementing fetures towards a specific milestone, only 
commits related to that milestone should be included in your pull request.

Pull request commit messages should include a sane and descriptive first line message not longer than 70 characters, optionally 
followed by a short description of the commit and a list of all issues worked on with their associated issue #.

----
<1> Sane and descriptive commit first line, in Github, this is the title of the pull request
<2> Optional, short description of this commit
<3> List of issues addressed in this pull request

TIP: Try to keep your pull requests short and sweet

==== Receive feedback

Once you have opened a pull request, all project "watchers" will be notified. If necessary, you may want to also
connect with them out of band, via IM or email, and let them know you have submitted a pull request for review. The
merge master or code reviewers should view the pull request, pull it to their local machine for testing, and add
any comments to the pull request. You should respond to these comments as quickly as possible, either inline or by
adding additional commits to your branch and pushing it to the origin repository.

TIP: Always respond to feedback as quickly as possible

==== Rebase or merge (if necessary)

If your pull request stays open for a long time, you may find that other changes have been merged to the upstream master
branch before your pull request has been. In order to faciliate merging your pull request, you should pull the upstream
changes into your branch. You can do this simply by running `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master`. You may
need to resolve conflicts, which you should do carefully and commit the result. After committing, push your feature branch
back to origin repository in order to udpate your pull request.

TIP: Always keep your branches up-to-date with the upstream master

==== Start again

Once the feedback cycle is completed, the merge master will merge your code. You are now ready to start work on another
feature by checking out master, resetting it, and creating a feature branch. Keep in mind that there is nothing preventing
you from maintaining several feature branches and pull requests at a time. The git checkout command is extremely fast,
and wherever possible independent features should be kept as independent commits so they can be referenced 
in the future.
