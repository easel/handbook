Javascript Standards
--------------------

[[introduction]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Focus on readability and maintainability. The code's should be easy to
understand, or obvious, to a junior-level developer.
* Write tests. Every project should have a functional test runner, and
be - configured to run the tests via CI.
* Use bower for your frontend components. Check in the artifacts to
components AND keep bower.json up to date.
* Use npm for backend components, and grunt to automate the toolchain.
Check in the artifacts in node_modules and keep package.json up to date.
Base your project on "backpain" and stay up to date with it.

[[code-guidelines]]
Coding Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code styling is represented by the following guidelines. You can see an
explanation of each point in http://jscode.org/03c498

Indentation::
    Spaces
Spacing::
    2 Spaces
Readability::
    Normal
Blocks::
    Inline
Variables Naming::
    Normal
Top Level Variables Naming::
    Normal
Top Level Variables::
    TitleCase
Local and pass-through Variables::
    camelCase
Functions Naming::
    Normal
Functions Case::
    camelCase
Comma in Variable Declaration::
    Trailing Comma
Concatenation::
    Trailing
Quotes::
    Single

Below you can find some sample code that follows these guidelines.
It should have examples for most of the situations you'll encounter:

[[libraries]]
Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

Use the following. Don't use other stuff without a good reason and a
conversation.

* require.js
* require-handlebars (.hbs)
* JQuery
* Underscore
* BackBone.js
* handlebars
* Chiropracter

[[best-practices]]
Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[file-layout]]
File Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create requireJS modules
* No capital letters in filenames.
* Use underscores in module names
* modules should follow the "standard" backbone layout
* module_name
** views
** add.js
** edit.js
** delete.js
* models
** module_data.js
* templates
** add.hbs
** edit.hbs
** delete.hbs

[[require.js]]
Require.js
^^^^^^^^^^

* Keep the optimizer configured, and run it regularly. If code doesn't
work optimized, it doesn't work.
* Include all dependencies at the module level, not dynamically inside
functions and such.
* Require modules should define dependencies and return a module object.
They should be idempotent and not dependent on global state.

[[backbone.js]]
BackBone.js
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Follow backbone naming conventions
* Use backbone modules
* make sure to include jquery-cors for cross-domain API access support

[[Loops]]

When using loops the preferred method is to use _.each

include::loops-best-practice.js[]
----

[[Multiple async tasks]]

To handle multiple async tasks such as multiple model saves or
multiple model fetch it is best done with $.when.apply(null, deferreds).then
----
include::async.js[]

[[Formatting]]

This is recommended jsformat settings when using Sublime Text 2
