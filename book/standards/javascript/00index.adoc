Javascript Standards
--------------------

[[introduction]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Focus on readability and maintainability. The code's should be easy to
understand, or obvious, to a junior-level developer.
* Write tests. Every project should have a functional test runner, and
be - configured to run the tests via CI.
* Use bower for your frontend components. Check in the artifacts to
components AND keep bower.json up to date.
* Use npm for backend components, and grunt to automate the toolchain.
Check in the artifacts in node_modules and keep package.json up to date.
Base your project on "backpain" and stay up to date with it.

[[code-guidelines]]
Coding Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code styling is represented by the following guidelines. You can see an
explanation of each point in http://jscode.org/03c498

Indentation::
    Spaces
Spacing::
    2 Spaces
Readability::
    Normal
Blocks::
    Inline
Variables Naming::
    Normal
Module Level Variables Naming::
    Normal
Module Level Variables::
    TitleCase
Local and pass-through Variables::
    camelCase
Functions Naming::
    Normal
Functions Case::
    camelCase
Comma in Variable Declaration::
    Trailing Comma
Concatenation::
    Trailing
Quotes::
    Single

Below you can find some sample code that follows these guidelines.
It should have examples for most of the situations you'll encounter:

[[libraries]]
Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

Use the following. Don't use other stuff without a good reason and a
conversation.

* require.js
* require-handlebars (.hbs)
* JQuery
* Underscore
* BackBone.js
* handlebars
* Chiropracter

[[best-practices]]
Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[file-layout]]
File Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create requireJS modules
* No capital letters in filenames.
* Use underscores in module names
* modules should follow the "standard" backbone layout
* module_name
** views
** add.js
** edit.js
** delete.js
* models
** module_data.js
* templates
** add.hbs
** edit.hbs
** delete.hbs

[[require.js]]
Require.js
^^^^^^^^^^

* Keep the optimizer configured, and run it regularly. If code doesn't
work optimized, it doesn't work.
* Include all dependencies at the module level, not dynamically inside
functions and such.
* Require modules should define dependencies and return a module object.
They should be idempotent and not dependent on global state.

[[backbone.js]]
BackBone.js
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Follow backbone naming conventions
* Use backbone modules
* make sure to include jquery-cors for cross-domain API access support

[[Loops]]

When using loops the preferred method is to use _.each

include::loops-best-practice.js[]
----

[[Multiple async tasks]]

To handle multiple async tasks such as multiple model saves or
multiple model fetch it is best done with $.when.apply(null, deferreds).then
----
include::async.js[]

[[Formatting]]

This is recommended jsformat settings when using Sublime Text 2

[[Backbone Patterns]]

Here is a list of good patterns and pratices while developing and
building Backbone applications.

File structure:

In most projects in wiser it is recommended to follow this type of structure:

/...
    <project name>
        /collections
        /handlebars
        /models
        /templates
        /views
        app.js
        router.js
        views.js

Views:

The /views folder should be seperated by module name in larger projects

e.g.

/views
    /header
    /nav
    /module1
    /module2
    base.js
    mixins.js

Following best practices it is better to not do any rendering code within the
view class unless there is good reason.

----
include::views.js[]
----

For view cleanup because this is not handled automatically by backbone you should
make sure that view.remove() gets called before you render or navigate to a different
page.  This will allow objects/bindings/events to cleanup before you render the new
view  Please see below for example of how to do this.  This code would be used in
the router for example by all views which will render the view.

Also render should only be called by this structure ALWAYS:

 $("#page-layout").html(view.render().el);  // there is numerous reasons for this.
